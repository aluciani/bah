# Credits
The Bah compiler uses open-source projects listed below:
- [Garbage collector](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc)
- [Open SSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
- [Sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html)

In addition to these projects, Bah is translated to C before beeing compiled.
To do so, it makes use of a C compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for Linux, [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for MacOS and [Mingw Gcc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) for windows.
