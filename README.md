# [Bah-lang](https://bah-lamg.xyz)

## Installation
> Bah supports only linux for the moment.

To install bah on your machine, get the terminal warmed up 🔥 , stretch your fingers up 🏋‍♂ and paste this 😎:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ithirzty/bah
cd ./bah
./install.sh
```

## Usage
Files containing bah code have the `.bah` extenstion.
- To compile your program, use `bah myFile.bah`.
- To translate your program as C code, use `bah myFile.bah -c`.
- To set an output name to your program, use the `bah myFile.bah -o myCompiledProgram`.

## Why?
Bah is a really fast language that is low level enough for most cases while being really simple.
As well as being easy to learn, you can create 
- website (such as the [bah-lang](https://bah-lang.xyz) website),
- compilers (the bah compiler is written in bah),
- web apps (the documentation of bah is wrapped up in a [web app](https://github.com/ithirzty/bah-website)),
- and many more.
